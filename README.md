# Task 2 - Factorials

[Factorials](https://github.com/tvmarinov/C-Tasks/blob/master/Factorials/Factorials/Factorials.cs) is a console application which calculates factorials in the range of 0-10 and print them 1000 times in a format

```
1 1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880 3628800
1 1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880 3628800
...
1 1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880 3628800
```

Excecution time of the application is as follows:

- Printing every factorial on a new line -> ~650ms
- Printing a set of factorials in the range of 0-10 on a new line (as the format above shows) -> ~400ms
- Predefining/Precalculating factorials and printing them afterwards -> 50ms
